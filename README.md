## Running

The launcher is the recommended way to play. It authenticates with your Microsoft account and starts the client automatically. \
Clone the repository and run the following commands.

```
cd BetaSharp.Launcher
dotnet run --configuration Release
```

## Building

Clone the repository and make sure the .NET 10 SDK is installed. For installation, visit https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download. \
The Website lists instructions for downloading the SDK on Windows, macOS and Linux.

It is recommended to build with `--configuration Release` for better performance. \
The server and client expect the JAR file to be in their running directory.

```
cd BetaSharp.(Launcher/Client/Server)
dotnet build
```
